🔍 What is TransAbuja Shuttle?

TransAbuja Shuttle is a clean-energy ride service designed to provide affordable, efficient, and blockchain-powered transport to underserved and high-traffic areas within Abuja.

Using compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and Pi Network peer-to-peer payments, this project pioneers an alternative to traditional cash-based systems and makes digital finance practical for everyday city commuters.

🌐 Why It Matters

🚆 Most commuters in Abuja rely on costly, unreliable transport systems

💸 Cash-based payment methods are vulnerable to fraud and inefficiency

🔋 Fossil fuel dependence inflates costs and increases emissions

📲 Blockchain is underutilized in real-world services — we change that
