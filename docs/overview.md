# Project Overview
TransAbuja Shuttle makes transport affordable in Abuja with CNG and Pi Network:
- **Why:** Fuel subsidy removal (2023) doubled fares (e.g., Zuba-Area 1: N500+).
- **What:** 20 CNG vehicles (10 mini-vans, 10 taxis) paid via Pi Browser.
- **Cost:** $700K ($450K vehicles, $150K depot, $50K app).
- **Goal:** 380 Pi/day (~$608), 10,000+ users in 6 months.
- **Lead:** Emmanuel Khaka Gana (@khaka8021)
